Detailed breakdowns for the solution to leetcode problems. Goes through the Topics covered, the solution algorithm, The intuition behind the algorithms, and states the time complexity. Solutions here are a mixture of my own, and those by [This Source](https://walkccc.me/LeetCode/) that provide better algorithms.

### Important Things To Note
1. The purpose of this repository is to study the solutions that others have provided, and to learn various techniques and ways of thinking to approach things. While some solutions in this repository are my own, please assume that I am studying the solutions provided in that repository. If my own solution ended up being both optimal _and_ easy enough to understand that I put it in this list over the repository, I will say so.
2. All solutions are in java
3. All problems are then reattempted without reading these solutions, in order to internalize techniques and information. If you want to study with these explanations, I highly advise doing the same
4. **ALL EXPLANATIONS ARE MY OWN WORDS AND UNDERSTANDING.** They are written solely by me, and after I feel like I have appropriately grasped a problem and its solution.
