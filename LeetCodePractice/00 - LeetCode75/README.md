# LEETCODE 75 STUDY GUIDE
## Introduction
This is a personal project to document and explain solutions from the [LeetCode 75 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/). The intention of this project is to not only find solutions to each of these problems, but to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge and documentation of the topic. My hopes for this project is that it will not only help me in retaining code theory through practice, but to also help me solidify a strategy for documentation.

While each problem will be approached in earnest, there will be times where I will need to cross reference solutions, either because I have become stuck, or because I feel that my own solution is inelegant. I will mainly be referring to [this repository](https://walkccc.me/LeetCode/), and will mention at the beginning of the document if a solution has been cross referenced from there. If there are other solutions I cross referenced, then I will include them as well.

## Structure

The structure of the posts will be as Followed:
- **Leetcode Question Title**: The title and number of the problem, as well as a link to it.
- **Cross Referenced Solutions**: If there are any solutions that are cross referenced, then they will be put in this section. Otherwise, N/A will be put in it.
- **Concepts**: The concepts that the problem is touching upon.
- **Instructions**: Instructions, as they are given on the site
- **Given Hints**: Hints, as they are given on the site. If no hints have been given, this section will say N/A.
- **Intuition**: The intuition to the problem. Gives insight as to how the problem should be approached.
- **Step By Step Solution**: The step by stemp breakdown of the solution
- **Explaining the Solution**: An explanation of the solution to highlight why things are done.
- **Code**: The actual code of the solution
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the solution.
