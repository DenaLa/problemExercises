An [**array**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_type)) is a data type that many high level programming languages offer. It is a collection of elements that can be referred to by index, most commonly with the notation `Array[i]`. Because array indeces can be calculated at runtime, a single statement is enough to be able to process any arbitrary element inside an array. Arrays can eithe be one dimensional or multi dimensional, and they usually have a fixed size upon initialization. The elements of an array are usually required to be the same data type, and high level languages have bounds checking to ensure that code is properly accessing data from inside te array. Other qualities such as Index Origin (whether the Array begins at 1 or 0), Highest Index, and functions that are available to be done on an array depend on the programming language.

A [**string**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) is a data type that many high level programming languages offer. A string primarily allows for the storage of human readable text. Strings usually utilize Unicode encoding in order account for different languages. Whether or not a string is mutable, and how a string is implemented within a programming language depends on the programming language.
